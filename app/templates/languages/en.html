Specifying 'option redispatch' will allow the proxy to break their persistence and redistribute them to a working server. It also allows to retry connections to another server in case of multiple connection failures. Of course, it requires having 'retries' set to a nonzero value.",

This is sometimes annoying when the client\'s IP address is expected in server logs. To solve this problem, the well-known HTTP header 'X-Forwarded-For' may be added by HAProxy to all requests sent to the server. This header contains a value representing the client\'s IP address. Since this header is always appended at the end of the existing header list, the server must be configured to always use the last occurrence of this header only. See the server\'s manual to find how to enable use of this standard header. Note that only the last occurrence of the header must be used, since it is really possible that the client has already brought one.",
